Project:	Physics Project #2
Group Members:	Jason Chan, Joseph Deschene-Poole, David Moniz
Due Date:	November 13, 2011

Controls:
	Plane:	
		Forward  	 - W
		Backwards 	 - S
		Left	 	 - A
		Right	 	 - D
		Up		     - Z
		Down		 - X
		Stop		 - V (Used for Debugging)

	Camera: 
		Forward  	 - Up
		Bacwards 	 - Down
		Left		 - Left
		Right		 - Right
		Up	 		 - PgUp
		Down		 - PgDown

Features: 
	Large 100k+ Enviroment
	Controlable Model - Plane
	Rendering and Simulation seperate
	When collision happens Plane stops
	AABBs generated at run-time (6 Levels)
	Pitch, Roll, and Yaw not implimented due to complexity but the plane moves in the appropriate directions
	Model is moved by adding velocity and not acceleration because there would be no decay in space
